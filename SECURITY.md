## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you wish to report a security vulnerability -- thank you! -- we ask that you follow the following process:

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues or disclose the vulnerability publicly until a fix is released!**

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to **[security@mltooling.org](mailto:security@mltooling.org)**. Please add a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and if known, mitigations or fixes for the issue. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report. Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
